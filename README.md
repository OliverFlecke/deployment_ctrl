# Deployment Controller

The idea behind this app is to have a simple controller to help with deployment of various services.
Currently these are served as static files or in docker containers, which manually has to be deployed.

## Features

- [ ] Pull new changes for a git repo to serve static files
- [ ] Pull new docker image and start new container
